        <h1>My Motivation:</h1>

<hr><p>I am a big fan of Game of Thornes, seriously.
This is the first TV series, that I have watched all its epsoides in the last 10 years.</p>

<p>I have started to play <a href="http://amzn.to/XBgVIs">The Game Of Thrones Board Game</a> with a couple of friends, some are in CA and some are in Israel. Quickly I learned that the existing tools to manage remote games are super complicated and I was happy to build some tools to help with the game managment.</p>

<p>I have built this tiny site in couple of hours. This is just the initial version. 
At the moment the only feature that it provides is a a persistent deck for the wildlings cards. The system is built on trust and it is very easy to screw up with it. :) I promise that if there will be more than two active games I will make it more secure.</p>

<p>The current deck managment is pretty flexiable so I am probably going to add the other decks as well.</p>

<p>The site is currenly hosted at: (<a href="http://gamesofthrones.herokuapp.com/">http://gamesofthrones.herokuapp.com/</a>)</p>

<h1>About the code:</h1>

<hr><p>Currently I am using Rails and Postgres.</p>

<p>Feel free to contribute, <strong>code-review my code,</strong> and/or contact me for any feature requests,</p>

<p>Yoni</p>
