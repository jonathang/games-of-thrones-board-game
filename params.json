{"name":"Games-of-thrones-board-game","tagline":"A very simple web interface to shuffle and persist the game cards so I can play it with my nerdy friends in CA and Israel.","body":"# My Motivation:\r\n***\r\n\r\nI am a big fan of Game of Thornes, seriously.\r\nThis is the first TV series, that I have watched all its epsoides in the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nI have started to play [The Game Of Thrones Board Game](http://amzn.to/XBgVIs) with a couple of friends, some are in CA and some are in Israel. Quickly I learned that the existing tools to manage remote games are super complicated and I was happy to build some tools to help with the game managment.\r\n\r\nI have built this tiny site in couple of hours. This is just the initial version. \r\nAt the moment the only feature that it provides is a a persistent deck for the wildlings cards. The system is built on trust and it is very easy to screw up with it. :) I promise that if there will be more than two active games I will make it more secure.\r\n\r\nThe current deck managment is pretty flexiable so I am probably going to add the other decks as well.\r\n\r\nThe site is currenly hosted at: (http://gamesofthrones.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n#About the code: \r\n***\r\nCurrently I am using Rails and Postgres.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contribute, **code-review my code,** and/or contact me for any feature requests,\r\n\r\nYoni","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
