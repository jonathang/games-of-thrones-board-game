    My Motivation:
    ==============

    I am a big fan of Game of Thornes, seriously.
    This is the first TV series, that I have watched all its epsoides in the last 10 years.

    I have started to play [The Game Of Thrones Board Game](http://amzn.to/XBgVIs) with a couple of friends, some are in CA and some are in Israel. <br> Quickly I learned that the existing tools to manage remote games are super complicated and I was happy to build some tools to help with the game managment.

    I have built this tiny site in couple of hours.
    This is just the initial version. At the moment the only feature that it provides is a a persistent deck for the wildlings cards. The systme is built on trust and it is very easy to screw up with it. :) I promise that if there will be more than two active games I will make it more secure.

    The current deck managment is pretty flexiable so I am probably going to add the other decks as well.

    The site is currenly hosted at: (http://gamesofthrones.herokuapp.com/)


    About the code: Currently I am using Rails and Postgres.

    Feel free to contribute, code-review my code, and/or contact me for any requests,
    Yoni
